# VisionTransformer-MNIST
This notebook is designed to plot the attention maps of a vision transformer trained on MNIST digits. Looking at the attached gif, the neural net knows where to “pay attention”.

I’ve looked at multiple resources, but these two were particularly useful:
  - https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/notebooks/course_UvA-DL/11-vision-transformer.html
  - https://medium.com/@hirotoschwert/an-unofficial-colab-walkthrough-of-vision-transformer-8bcd592ba26a
